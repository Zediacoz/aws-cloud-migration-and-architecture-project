# aws-cloud-migration-and-architecture-project

This project simulates a real-world DevOps platform build for a mid-size SaaS company migrating a core service to AWS EKS. 
It focuses on infrastructure as code, automated delivery, production-grade observability, and cost efficiency. 

The platform is built using Terraform to provision cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes for workload orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines to enable repeatable, low-risk deployments. 
Prometheus and Grafana provide monitoring and alerting, supported by runbooks and incident documentation that reflect real on-call operations. Cost efficiency is treated as a first-class concern, with autoscaling, right-sized resource requests, and documented cost guardrails designed to reduce waste while maintaining reliability. 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate hands-on DevOps engineering skills across the full lifecycle: designing infrastructure, 
deploying and operating services in production-like environments, responding to incidents, and continuously improving reliability and cost efficiency.
